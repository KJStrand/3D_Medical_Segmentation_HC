# Expected results

Artefacts from Section 2:  
  
* Functional code that trains the segmentation model
* Test report with Dice scores on test set (json file). Final average Dice is around .90
* Screenshots from Tensorboard output, showing Train and Validation loss plots, along with images of the predictions that the model is making at different stages of training
* Trained model PyTorch parameter file (`model.pth`)
