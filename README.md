Project completed as part of Udacity AI for Healthcare course (2020).

U-net model is applied to CT brain scan to segment volume of the hippocampus. Measuring hippocampal volume is useful in monitoring progression of Alzheimer's disease, however it is time consuming and challenging to do by hand. Automated AI segmentation offers fast and accurate 3D volume results for interpretation by radialogist.
